The code used for my master thesis "Data-Driven Exploration of SiC MOSFET Aging Using Symbolic Regression". The symbolic regression was implemnted by utilzing PySR. The main code for the regression is in "V_vs_T" and "V_vs_CL", where I looked for equations describing how volatage is related to temperature and consumedlife. This was done on experimental datta from a PCT on SiC MOSFETS
The python file for data cleaning is the collection of the functions derived in the correspoding jupyter file.
